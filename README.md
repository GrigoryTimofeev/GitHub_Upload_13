# Fintech Module 13 Challenge: FinTech Module 13 Challenge: Binary classification model using a deep neural network.

To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.
This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. You will do the following:
* Preprocess data for a neural network model.
* Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
* Optimize the model.

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3 along with the following packages:

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/urls.html#managing-workspaces-ui) - For information about the jupyter lab remote workspace hosted by a local computer.
